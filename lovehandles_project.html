			<p> This is Lovehandles. Meet him (her?). Love him. Cherish him. Because that right there was the product of months of sweat, tears, and well, love. </p>
			<p> Packed in that small(ish) exterior is quite a powerhouse of 36V of battery, a ___ motor, and enough power to max out at a solid 20 mph with a medium-female-sized rider. </p>
			<p> We were posed with a few design constraints:our car could have no more than four 12V batteries, it could not exceed 20 mph (for safety reasons), it needed to be able to carry a single rider, and we needed to stay within a budget of $400. With these parameters in mind, we set out on our merry ways to conceptualize, design, and finally build what is now Lovehandles. </p>
